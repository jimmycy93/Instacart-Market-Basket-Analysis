# Market-Basket-Analysis
A practice on Instacart dataset

## Project Introduction
After some survey on association rules, I decided to do some practice on market basket analysis. This little project aims to find interesting rules according to the Instacart data, as well as going deep into the rules to answer some related questions, and finally conclude with some recommend actions that might create business value.

## Data Description
The project take use of The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017, Accessed from https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017 on 2017-09-16. Some preprocessing were done to the files.

   1. Extract only the first 14000 transactions from [order_products__train.csv].
    
   2. Added a column of product_name corresponding to product_id from [products.csv].
   
   3. Added a column of user_id corresponding to order_id from [orders.csv]. 

The file name of the preprocessed data is [Market Basket-Instacart], the variable names are trivial.
