# Market-Basket-Analysis
A practice on Instacart dataset

## Project introduction
After some survey on association rules, I decided to practice my skills on market basket analysis. This analysis aims to find interesting rules according to the Instacart data, as well as going deep into the rules to answer some related questions, and finally conclude with some recommend actions that might create business value.
